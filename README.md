# flutter_app_cse

A sample [Google Custom Search](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/) Flutter demo.
It uses [Custom Search JSON API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview) to get search result.

We use [expire_cache](https://github.com/guojiex/expire_cache) to make sure the same search request will not be fired multiple times(with TTL for the cache entry).
