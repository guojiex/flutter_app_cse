# flutter_app_cse

A sample [Google Custom Search](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/) Flutter demo.
It uses [Custom Search JSON API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview) to get search result.

We use [expire_cache](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/expire_cache) to make sure the same search request will not be fired multiple times(with TTL for the cache entry).

Use [bubble_tab_indicator](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/bubble_tab_indicator) to show refinement tab as bubble tabs.
